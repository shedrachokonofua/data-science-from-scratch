## Important Caveats

### Simpsons Paradox
Correlations can be misleading when confounding variables are ignored.
When measuring correlation, the underlying assumption is that *all else being equal*
we can plot a valid relationship between random variables. Poorly chosen data classes
can lead to untrue or incomplete conclusions being made so one must be careful in
checking for possible confounding factors and ensuring a working knowledge of the data set.

### Correlation vs Causation
Strong correlation between 2 variables, x and y, could mean:
- x causes y
- y causes x
- each causes the other
- a third factor causes both
- or, very important to note, nothing at all.

*One way to feel more confident about causality is by conducting randomized trials.*
